# Comparative Evaluation of Object Detection Models

This project presents a comparative study of modern object detection architectures on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The models evaluated include:

- YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large)
- DETR (ResNet-50, ResNet-101)
- RF-DETR
- YOLO-NAS
- OWL-ViT2 (Zero-Shot Detection)

## ðŸš€ Models & Methodology

### 1. YOLOv8
Trained using the Ultralytics library on VOC-formatted data converted via Roboflow. YOLOv8 variants showed strong real-time performance with increasing accuracy from Nano to X-Large.

### 2. DETR
Fine-tuned Facebook AI's DETR using ResNet backbones. COCO-to-VOC conversion and classification head replacement enabled effective adaptation to the VOC dataset.

### 3. RF-DETR
Based on Roboflow's Deformable DETR with ViT/DINOv2 backbones. Supports real-time inference with over 60 mAP on COCO and seamless Roboflow integration.

### 4. YOLO-NAS
A new hybrid NAS-based model balancing speed and accuracy. Implemented using [DigitalOcean's guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/yolo-nas#about-the-article) and Roboflow [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-nas/).

### 5. OWL-ViT2
Evaluated without fine-tuning. Zero-shot object detection using natural language prompts and HuggingFace's OWL-ViT2 base model.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- **YOLOv8-X** outperforms other variants in accuracy but with increased compute.
- **RF-DETR** offers a great tradeoff between accuracy and real-time performance using DINOv2 + deformable attention.
- **DETR** still demonstrates competitive performance with its end-to-end design.
- **OWL-ViT2** enables generalized detection without retraining, valuable for open-set scenarios.
